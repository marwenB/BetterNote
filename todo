Fix later/questions
-- sidebar: what to do if item name is too long for the line
-- delete button in dropdown: how to make it clickable across the whole line, not just on the text
-- on comment create, controller redirects :back, which includes new comment form (needs to be removed--shouldn't be a problem w/ javascript)
-- scroll bar for note page goes all the way up to top (next to nav bars): shouldn't go up all the way
-- see why images aren't uploading to heroku (irrelevant once AWS is set up)
-- refactor search query in notebooks/tags/users controllers

-- check bottom border on header on sign in page
-- check alignment of dropdown icons in sidebar
-- add "cancel" button to popup

-- resizing note body box (how do you set height?)
-- why does blur stop click event?
-- destroy click handlers on view change
